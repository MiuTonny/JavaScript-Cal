/* 
  Simple Calculator Project

  - Implements basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), 
    multiplication (*), and division (/).
  
  - Each operation is defined as a function that takes two numbers (a, b) 
    and returns the result.

  - A history array stores each calculation, including the operands, operator, 
    and result.

  - The division function includes error handling to display a message 
    if division by zero is attempted.

  - A function is also included to display the full history of calculations.
